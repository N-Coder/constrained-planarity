# `Problem Name`

## Definition

`Terse Problem Definition`

## Background

`History of the Problem, its introduction and attempts at solutions, relationship to other problems, etc.`

## Complexity

`Variables needed for the complexity`
`Problem` can be solved in time...
`Problem` is NP-complete for instances...

- $O(n+d\cdot \Delta)\subset O(n^4)$ via Synchronized Planarity with SPQR-node expansion

- where the shared graph is a star.

### Partial Solutions

- Polynomial if the subgraph induced by any cluster is connected [@Lengauer1989; @Feng1995]
